# Nutrition-Calculator
This program allows you to build custom 'meals'  from ingredients you have added, and see the cumulative nutritional value of the meal. The nscrape.py file uses an API with the USDA nutritional database to pull nutrition information into a local SQLite database. The nbuildmeal.py file prompts you to specify the food items and quantities in the meal, calculates the nutritional value of the entire meal across 20 nutrients, and allows you to name and save the meal to the SQLite database. The program uses the terminal as the user interface, and all the coding is in the Python language.
